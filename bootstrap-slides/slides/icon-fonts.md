##  Icon fonts

Bootstrap comes bundled with a subset of glyphicons for free.  These files can be noticed in the fonts directory of the
download. You can use any of these icons by applying the class glyphicon glyphicon-whatever to an i element.


        <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-envelope"></i>

would render an email icon.
